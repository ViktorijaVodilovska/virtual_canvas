# Virtual Canvas

Virtual canvas is a simple application for drawing (something like a virtual white board).

The application is a school project, and is meant to try out detecting objects using OpenCV.

Further development and improvements might be done in the future.

## Installation

The project uses standard python libraries.
The additional libraries are included in the folder and do not need to be installed.

Python needs to be installed on your machine.
A camera input is necessairy.

## Usage

The user needs to have a camera enabled facing them. 
A red ball (or similar red object) is required.

The application detects the red object and follows its movement, drawing out its trajectory.

There is a color menu and a CLEAR button which can be used by hovering the red object in the desired option-block.
